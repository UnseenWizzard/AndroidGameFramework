AndroidGameFramework
====================

A game framework for android, based on the tutorial at kilobolt.com, which itself is based on the book Beginning Android Games Development (by Mario Zechner and Robert Green). 

Currently I'm directly basing this on the tutorial but will soon begin updating and changing this to suit my needs, when I start the "SpaceVival" game project.
